This is not an inventory program. I am making a JAva Desktop Application to help manage customer accounts via a website sales. Right now I am trying to pass values using public username from the jTextField in NewJFrame.form to items in framecust.form in the jTextField that associate with them. I am currently creating a socket with access to my database but this will remain private if any one want to help let me know.
